The Simple Todo List project is a full-stack application that consists of:

    A React frontend (client) for user interaction.
    A Node.js/Express backend (server) providing a RESTful API.
    A PostgreSQL database for storing todo items.
    A Docker Compose setup to orchestrate the containers for the client, server, and database.

This documentation outlines the repository structure and provides guidance for setting up and running the project.

```

```

Entire app should work by running:

docker-compose up --build

and going to http://localhost:3000 in the browser
